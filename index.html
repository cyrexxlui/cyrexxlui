<!-- starting here with the points-->

<!-- POINT 1-->

        <h2 id= "healthy-way" class = "titles">[1]:Muscle Gains.</h2>
        
        <h6>credit and sources: WikipediA</h6>
        
        <p> <strong>Bodybuilding</strong> is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature (muscle building) by muscle hypertrophy for aesthetic purposes.<br><br>
            Some bodybuilders use anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to build muscles and recover from injuries more quickly, but competitions sometimes ban using them because of the health risks or considerations regarding fair competition.<br> <br>
            
            <img src= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Ronnie_Coleman_8_x_Mr_Olympia_-_2009_-_5.png" width ="200">
            
            It's also possible to gain muscles without the use of Anabolic drugs, however the amount of muscle gain per year will be much less, and most likely you won't be able to compete against those that use either performance-enhancing drugs or anabolic steroid. <br><br>
            It all comes down to your objectives, but in General with or without, you will still need to exert the same efforts and follow the same strict diets to be able to achive a good physical condition.
        </p>
        

<!-- POINT 2 The Training Routine-->

        <h2 id="routine" class = "titles">[2]: The Training Routine.</h2>
        
        <p> <strong>Weight training</strong> is a common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles.<br> <br> 
        <img src= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Crossfit_gym_cz.jpg" width ="400"> 
        It utilizes the <em>force of gravity</em> in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction. Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.</p>
        
 
 <!-- POINT 3 Diet-->
      
        
        <h2 id="diet" class = "titles">3-The Diet.</h2>
        
        <p> It all depends on what your current phase goals will be! <br>

        <strong>Are you you looging to gain muscles? </strong>
        Then being on a calorie surplus and adding carbs to your diet will be essential.<br><br>
        <strong>Do you want to look lean or even shredded? </strong>
        
        Then being on a calorie <em>deficit is a Must</em> and at some point you will be removing carbs completely from your diet.<br>
        </p>
 
                <p> However you must develope what is called <strong> Metabolic Flexibility</strong> which means, your body must have the ability to utilize fats as a source of energy when needed, without depending on carbs for days or even weeks to be able to acheive that low body fat %
